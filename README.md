# HomelessAPI
 The project is a RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core using .NET 8, designed to facilitate the management of benefits for beneficiaries. It connects benefactors, who provide benefits, with beneficiaries, who are in need of these benefits. The API focuses on protecting the identity of beneficiaries while allowing benefactors to manage and track the benefits they offer.
