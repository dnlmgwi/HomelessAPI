# HomelessAPI [WIP]
 The project is a RESTful API built with ASP.NET Core using .NET 8, designed to facilitate the management of benefits for beneficiaries.
 It connects benefactors, who provide benefits, with beneficiaries, who are in need of these benefits. 
 The API focuses on protecting the identity of beneficiaries while allowing benefactors to manage and track the benefits they offer.

Key Features:

- Beneficiary Management: Register and manage beneficiaries, including their personal details and the benefits they have claimed.
- Benefactor Management: Allow benefactors to register, add new benefits, and track the benefits they provide.
- Benefit Tracking: Facilitate the tracking and management of benefits, including their descriptions and associations with beneficiaries and benefactors.
- Privacy-Conscious Design: Ensure the privacy of beneficiaries by handling sensitive information with care.
- Age Group Classification: Beneficiaries' ages are categorized into age groups rather than specific ages.
